    This site constains notes to myself on the journey that I learn about functional programming, technology, and careers. Therefore, most of the 
    blog posts are my own learning journey in Scala, functional programming, and document side projects and projects in my current workplace.

<p>
    I write this blog to document and share my thoughts about new concepts, philosophies, problems, and tools that I
    encounter and learn in my everyday work.
