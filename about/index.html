<h2 class="post-header mb2">Hey, I'm Edward.</h2>
<div class="post-summary">
    <p>I'm a software engineer working and living in California.</p>

    <p>
        I write this blog to document and share my thoughts about new concepts, philosophies, problems, and tools that I
        encounter and learn in my everyday work. I want to share my experience in the hope that others can avoid similar
        mistakes and struggles.
    </p>

    <p>
        I believe that the best way to learn something is by sharing that knowledge publicly. Therefore, you will see
        some
        topics that I write in this blog to make notes on myself a few years later when I forgot on that topic.
    </p>

    <p>
        I write about functional programming, distributed systems, and careers-development.
    </p>

    <p>
        All of the blog posts are my own opinions.
