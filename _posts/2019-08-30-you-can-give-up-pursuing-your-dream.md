Dreams are a wonderful thing. They filled with optimism, and it is the one thing that keeps us feel joy waking up every day feeling hope and purpose. However, how do you know if you need to stop dreaming and start being realistic? If you read and watch all the self-help books and videos out there, they will tell you to never give up and keep working hard. These authors proclaim that if we work hard enough and push through, there will be result.  Although this gives a very motivation thoughts and rosy pictures, it can be very misleading.  Despite how those motivational speech motivates us to pursue our dreams, there is always a chance that we pursue our dreams our entire life without reaching them. Perhaps you want to become a famous actor, but you might end up spending the rest of life taking on small theatre and working at a restaurant to pay the bill. Perhaps you want to start a business, but there is a chance that the business might not even take off. A lot of people get upset when their dreams cannot come to reality. 

What do you do when you no longer feel that passion to pursue that dream? It is hard to turn around when most of the self-help books and motivation videos tells you to “pursue your dream no matter what". 

It is okay to give up. Different mindset will appear on different situations and when you don’t see that dream is working, it is okay to stop pursuing and open doors for something else. Life is not about all or nothing. There are times when you think giving up on this dream is the best route to go, because it is not working. We don’t have to persist on the dreams no matter what. Then, how can you possibly decide how to run your life? The answer is simply to change your thought process, by ***shifting and focusing on the experience and process, instead of the outcome***.

## Outcome Based Thinking 
There is an assumption when you are pursuing your dream. That assumption is reaching the result is the most valuable part of the process. It implied that reaching that outcome will make you happy. This fact is driven by lots of stories from famous actors, billion-dollar company CEO, or the books with best-selling novels says that dreams is what matters the most. There is one problem with result-based thinking is that it doesn’t work. Because once you reach that level of success in your life, you will not be happy. You will quickly adjust to new reality, and constantly creating “new normal” and then you will want more. If you ask a successful CEO what the most valuable time is in establishing their success, they will tell you those times when they are optimistic and struggling. Achieving the goal itself doesn’t make you happy. It is the fulfillment of pursuing things, the things that you learn along that way that can make you grow. The process is what makes it fulfill.
It is not the outcome. 

## Experience Based Thinking
Instead of thinking about the outcome while you are pursuing your dreams, think through the process. Think about each dream as an experience that you want to have. If one doesn’t work out, you can always explore the next one. By this way of thinking, suddenly, quitting is not the matter of not being successful. You don’t feel guilty on yourself to quit something, because you are looking at your dreams as an experience. The reason of looking else is whether this dreams that I pursue still gives me fulfillment, passion, and enthusiasm? Do I feel alive? By the end of the day, you will see a lot more on the journey that you pursue, rather than the price itself. How it can make you grow, fulfilled, and enthusiasm.

We need to change our thinking from whether this dream can make you success to whether being a ***[blank blank]*** can help me grow. By thinking this way, fulfilling your dreams is just a tiny portion of life journey.

Sometimes quitting is a viable option when you know that the goals you pursue doesn’t give you the same fulfillment that once had. By quitting, you could prevent repeated failure, and create more rooms for other dreams and goals.
