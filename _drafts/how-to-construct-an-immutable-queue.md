When creating an immutable data structure, we often need to have a program that contains some state to mutate during the execution. 

One example is creating an immutable queue. In the scala library, you initialized an immutable queue like this:

```scala
val empty = Queue[Int]()

```

Then, you can enqueue a queue, which returns a new queue with the updated element. You can also dequeue a queue, which returns a tuple of the element that you remove, and the new queue.

```scala
val one = empty.enqueue(1)
val (one, emptyQ) = one.dequeue()
```

However, if you want to do a series of operations with the immutable queue, you need to pass the new element to the next operation. Like this:

```scala
val one = empty.enqueue(1)
val two = one.enqueue(2) // enqueue from one
val three = two.enqueue(3) // enqueue from two
```

It causes a lot of error-prone if you need to do many operations by explicitly passing off one state to the other.

In this article, I want to share how you can use the cats State monad to construct queue. By using State monad, constructing an immutable data structure does not need to pass one state to another explicitly. Hence, it decreases the amount of error-prone boilerplate.

## Order of execution
We start by implementing the regular immutable queue, which shows the same operation of a regular scala immutable queue. Then, we implement the same immutable queue, but with Cats State Monad.

Disclaimer: the queue implementation highly 

## Create Regular Immutable Queue
Let's create the constructor of the queue:
```scala
class FunctionalQueue[+A](vector:Vector[A])
```

The main class of the FunctionalQueue contains a vector to contain all the elements that are enqueued or dequeue.

Let's implement the enqueue and dequeue function:
```scala
def enqueue[B >: A](elmt:B): FunctionalQueue[B] = new FunctionalQueue(vector :+ elmt)
def dequeue: (A, FunctionalQueue[A]) = (vector.head, new FunctionalQueue[A](vector.tail))

```

The enqueue and dequeue function simply appending the value to the vector and retrieving the value from the vector.

Now, add a factory method for the FunctionalQueue constructor by defining the companion object.

```scala
object FunctionalQueue {
  def apply[A]():FunctionalQueue[A] = new FunctionalQueue[A](Vector.empty[A])
}
```

You can evoke the function in main, like this:
```scala
println(s"creating immutable queue without State monad")
val functionalQueue = FunctionalQueue[Int]
println(s"enqueue 1 immutable queue")
val enqueue1 = functionalQueue.enqueue(1)
println(s"enqueue 2 immutable queue")
val enqueue2 = enqueue1.enqueue(2)
println(s"front ${enqueue2.front}")
val (head, rest) = enqueue2.dequeue
println(s"dequeue head: ${head}  rest : ${rest}")
```

## What is State Monad
According to <a href="https://underscore.io/books/scala-with-cats/" target="_blank">Scala with Cats</a>, the State monad allows us to pass additional state around as part of a computation.

The representation of the State instance is `State[S,A]`, where it represents the function `S => (S,A)`. 

It means it takes in some state, and return a result along with the newly computed state.

Let's try creating a simple state:
```scala
import cats.data.State
val a = State[Int,String] {integerState =>
  (integerState, s"The state is ${state}")
}
```

The state wires all the computations before the first input variable is ready to pass in. After the program is all wired, you can pass in the initial state, and execute `run` to get the expected end state and its result.

```scala
val (endState, result) = a.run(2).value // 2 is the initial input that is passed in
// endState: 2 result : The state is 2
```

The power of the state lies in the map and flatMap functionality. It can thread the state from one instance to another.

Each state represents an individual transformation, and you can combine them by using flatMap to transform the complete sequence of changes:

In the below example, `plus1` and `plus2` returns a value of the computed new State and the description history of that computation.
```scala
import cats.data.State

val plus1 = State[Int, String]{state =>
  (state+1, s"The result of this state is ${state+1}")
}

val plus2 = State[Int,String] {state =>
  (state +2, s"The result of this state is ${state+2}")
}

val program = for {
  historyOne <- plus1 // historyOne is the String
  historyTwo <- plus2
} yield List(historyOne, historyTwo)

val (result, history) = program.run(0).value
// result = 3
// history = List("The result of this state is 1","The result of this state is 3" )

```

As you can see, `plus1` and `plus2` is threaded even if we don't interact with it in for comprehension.


## Refactor Functional Queue with State Monad

Now that you know how State monad works let's refactor the Functional Queue by using State monad.

Implement `enqueue` and `dequeue` with State monad.
```scala
type QueueFunc[A] = State[Vector[A], Option[A]]

def enqueue[A](elmt:A): QueueFunc[A] = State[Vector[A], Option[A]]{ oldVector =>
    (oldVector :+ elmt, oldVector.headOption)
  }

def dequeue[A]: QueueFunc[A] = State[Vector[A],Option[A]] { oldVector =>
  (oldVector.tail, oldVector.headOption)
}
```

I created `QueueFunc` as type alias that represent the `State[Vector[A], Option[A]]`. The State contains a Vector which contains a type `A`, and the optional head of the queue. The functions, enqueue and dequeue, take in an old vector and append or remove the head of the vector.

There you have it, we have done all of our implementation of the Immutable Queue with State!

How do you run the function?

Let's execute the same operation as `FunctionalQueue` with our new implementation.

Remember, we use flatMap to combine each operation without really interacting with its updated state.

We supply all the expected steps of execution. Then, we wire it a program that supplies its initial state and execute the `run` function. In this case, the initial value is an empty Vector.

```scala
// supply our operation
val program = for {
  _ <- enqueue[Int](1)
  _ <- enqueue[Int](2)
  end <- dequeue[Int]
} yield end


val (newState, head) = program.run(Vector.empty[Int]).value
// newState = Vector(2)
// head = 1

```

## Takeaway
- The State monad helps you eliminate all the error-prone boilerplate code that passes around the updated state to the next operation.
- The State monad instance passes in a State and returns the result along with its updated state.
- The power of State monad relies on `map` and `flatMap` operation, which threads one instance to another. Each state instances represent an atomic transformation. Their combination represents a sequence of changes. You don't need to interact with the intermediary state in the for comprehension.

The GitHub information has 3 different approaches to implementing an immutable queue. The first one is the regular immutable queue without the state monad (first example). The second one mimics the regular immutable queue interface with State monadâ€”the last implement stable state with State monad (2nd example of this article).
